       ////Inheritance: In object oriented programming languages like c# and java
       //- to implement inheritance, a class inherits from another class.
       // In JavaScript, we don't have the concept of classes, so inheritance in
       //- Js is prototype-based.This means to implement inheritance in JS,
       //- an object inherits from another object.
