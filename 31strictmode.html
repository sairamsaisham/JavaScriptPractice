        ////ECMAScript version 5 introduced strict mode to JavaScript. With strict mode on it is 
        //-easier to detect JavaScript silent errors as they would throw an error now. This makes 
        //-debugging much easier and the chances of developers making mistakes is reduced. Most modern browsers support strict mode.

       // For the list of most important restrictions that apply in strict mode, please refer the following MSDN article
